The files [`region.xml`](region.xml) and [`subdivision.xml`](subdivision.xml) are from the Unicode CDLR releases. The files are licensed under the [UNICODE LICENSE V3](LICENSE). They can be found at
[cldr.unicode.org](https://cldr.unicode.org/) and in the [Unicode CDLR repository](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/tree/main/common/validity/).

Parts of the data from these files are hardcoded in [`__init__.py`](__init__.py) with annotations regarding the validity and support of the flags
and a few additions of deprecated country codes.
The validity data is from the [Unicode Emoji report](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Flags).
The deprecated codes are from the [Unicode LDML report](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag-also-known-as-a-unicode-region-code-or-a-u).
The support of the flags was added manually by visually inspecting the flags
on the major platforms, Android, MacOS, iOS and various messenger apps (Windows does not support flags at all).

For easier visual inspection the data can be visualized as an [HTML table](../../docs/_static/report.html) generated by the tool [`html_report.py`](../../utils/html_report.py)
